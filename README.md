# Prediction of m6A Reader substrate sites using deep convolutional and recurrent neural network  
## Abstract
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent post-transcriptional modification in mRNA since it could regulate some significant biological functions with the binding of some m6A reader proteins. Multiple readers exist in the human genome, however, the binding specificity was not clarified due to the limited wet experiments on this topic. Therefore, we devised a deep learning approach which incorporated CNN and RNN frameworks together to predict the epitranscriptome-wide targets of six m6A reader proteins (YTHDF1-3, YTHDC1-2, EIF3A). We also utilized layer-wise relevance calculation to obtain contribution of each input feature. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with the average AUROC of 0.942 in EIF3A full transcript, compared with 0.929 in CNN-only framework and 0.817 in Support Vector Machine (SVM) method under same condition. Besides, we identified the optimal sequence length (1001bp) in the m6A reader substrate prediction. The results provide new insight into epitranscriptome target prediction and functional characterization of m6A readers.

Figure1 The sequence data are encoded by One-hot method and fed into the convolution layer and followed by the pooling layer twice to extract the significant features. The LSTM layer learns the long-term dependencies between sequence data generated by convolution layers. The flatten layer combines the previous kernels into a vector and inputs to the fully connected layer to calculate the probability of being m6A reader substrate site 

## Prerequisite packages
keras version 2.3.0, numpy, pandas, argparse

## Run 'python3 main.py -h' in command line for help

### Select the input genes
You could select 6 genes, including YTHDC1-2, YTHDF1-3, EIF3A

### Select the input length of the sequence
You could choose 251, 501, 1001, 2001bp input length to compare the prediction performance 

### Select the condition of the seqeunce, either full transcript (full) or mature RNA (exon)
To minimize the bias in selecting the polyA RNAs, we prepared the full transcript data and mature RNA data. In detail, mature RNA data exclude the sites on the intron region while the full transcript data covered either the exon or intron region.

### Choose the CNN or CNN+RNN model
To compare the performance under different framework

Figure3 Feature importance scores in EIF3A full transcript prediction. We both extracted upstream/downstream 50bp and upstream/downstream 250 bp of the sequence to rank the contribution of each nucleotide in determining the binding site. In each position, the higher score it gains, the higher contribution towards the binding sites.
